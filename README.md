Title: ETL Pipeline for Extracting and Transforming Global GDP Data
Overview:
I developed a Python-based ETL pipeline to automate the extraction and transformation of GDP data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This project simulated a real-world scenario of processing and delivering economic data for decision-making in an international business expansion context.
Key Objectives:
•	Extract GDP data from a website.
•	Transform the data to round GDP values to two decimal places.
•	Load the data into a JSON file and a database table with attributes for "Country" and "GDP_USD_billion."
•	Execute a database query to filter entries with GDPs greater than 100 billion USD.
•	Log the ETL process in a structured text file.
Tools & Technologies: Python, BeautifulSoup, SQLite, JSON, Logging Module
Outcome:
•	Successfully extracted and processed GDP data into desired formats.
•	Delivered insights by filtering countries with economies exceeding 100 billion USD.
•	Automated logging for better monitoring and debugging.
